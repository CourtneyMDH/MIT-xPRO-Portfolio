    <p>Ducks are among the few of natures creatures who can walk, swim, and fly. Therefore, they must be treated with reverence. We have all taken a duck from the park, of course, because they are free. Buy you duck a bowtie andd tell him, "Quack, good sir." This is the correct way to address your duck.</p>
